When a ship is activated, its owner reveals that ship’s top command dial and places it next to the ship in the play area. It can be spent immediately to assign the corresponding command token to that ship, or it can be spent at the appropriate time to resolve that command.

- After a ship finishes its activation, if it did not spend its command dial, that dial is discarded.
- When a command dial is spent or discarded, it is placed faceup on the ship’s ship card and remains there until it is assigned as a new command during the next Command Phase.
- A ship with a faceup command dial on its ship card cannot be activated.
- A player can look at their ships’ facedown command dials at any time. When a player looks at a ship’s command dials, they must preserve the order in which the command dials are stacked.
- When a ship gains an additional command dial from an effect during its activation, that dial can be spent immediately to assign the corresponding command token to that ship, or it can be spent at the appropriate time to resolve that command.
  - A ship reveals only the top facedown command dial assigned to it. Additional dials that ship gains are not revealed for the purposes of resolving other effects [^1].
