![Short Player Edges Diagram](https://a.l3n.co/i/z4xtr7.png)

Some objective cards refer to the 3’ edges of the play area becoming the player edges. Place the setup area markers at the corners of the play area when playing with these objectives. The setup area is the entire play area. Each player’s deployment zone is within the distance measured by the length of two range rulers from that player’s edge (see diagram on page 18) [^1].
