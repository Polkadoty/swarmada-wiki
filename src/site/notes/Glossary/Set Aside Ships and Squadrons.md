Some effects refer to ships or squadrons being set aside, typically before the “Deploy Ships” step of setup. The player controlling the set-aside ship or squadron places it outside the play area near its ship or squadron card along its player’s edge. These effects specify when those ships or squadrons can be deployed later in the game.
- A ship or squadron that is set aside can only be deployed or affected by the effect that set them aside.
- A set-aside ship or squadron can only be assigned objective tokens or chosen as an objective ship if that effect is resolved before the effect that sets that ship or squadron aside.
- If a player has set-aside ships or squadrons remaining but all of that player’s ships in the play area are destroyed, the game immediately ends.
