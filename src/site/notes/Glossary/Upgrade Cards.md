When building a fleet, upgrade cards can be equipped to ships by adding their fleet point costs to the total fleet point cost. For each upgrade icon in a ship’s upgrade bar, it may equip one upgrade card with the matching upgrade icon.

- Equipped upgrade cards are placed next to the ship card to which they are equipped. 
- A Rebel ship cannot equip an Imperial or other faction’s upgrade card, and an Imperial ship cannot equip a Rebel or other faction’s upgrade card. A card’s faction affiliation, if any, is indicated by the faction’s symbol to the left of the fleet point cost.
	- Some cards have a dual faction affiliation, indicated by a split faction symbol that shows both of the factions that card is affiliated with. A ship of either of those factions can equip that card.
- Some upgrade cards have more than one upgrade icon. For each group of these icons in a ship’s upgrade bar, it may equip one upgrade card with the matching upgrade icons. That group of icons cannot be used to equip additional upgrade cards.
- Some upgrade cards have a restriction trait that limits them to being taken by certain ships. A ship cannot equip an upgrade card if that ship does not match that restriction trait, even if that ship has the correct upgrade icon or icons in its upgrade bar.
	- A ship cannot have more than one upgrade card with the “Modification” trait.
	- A ship cannot equip an upgrade card if that ship is not of a size class specified by that upgrade card’s size restriction trait.
	- A ship cannot equip an upgrade card with the flagship restriction trait if that ship is not the flagship.
	- A ship cannot equip an upgrade card if that ship lacks a trait matching that upgrade card’s ship-trait restriction trait. Some ships have traits listed on the back of their ship cards.
- A title card can be equipped to a ship only if the ship and the title card share the same ship icon.
	- Some title cards have an icon in the lower-left corner that does not match a specific ship icon. A ship can equip this upgrade card if that ship matches this card’s faction affiliation and the ship’s name matches this upgrade card’s name-restriction trait.
	- Some title cards have a restriction trait that limits them to being taken by certain ship cards. A ship cannot equip an upgrade card if that ship’s name does not match the upgrade card’s name-restriction trait, even if its ship silhouette does match the silhouette on the upgrade card.
- A ship cannot have more than one title card.
- A commander card can be equipped to any non-flotilla ship of the appropriate faction. 
- If a ship’s upgrade card is discarded, it is flipped facedown but remains equipped for the purposes of scoring.
- On upgrade card effects, the term “you” refers to the ship that the upgrade is equipped to.
- An exhausted upgrade card cannot be exhausted again.
- Upgrade cards are readied during the Status Phase.
- Upgrade cards were printed as mini-size cards prior to the introduction of the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance factions. These cards remain legal game components [^1].
