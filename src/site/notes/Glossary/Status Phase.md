During this phase, the players ready all of their exhausted defense tokens by flipping them to their readied side. They also ready all of their exhausted upgrade cards by rotating them 90Â° counterclockwise. Then, the first player flips the initiative token to its other side.

- At the end of this phase, the first player places the round token with the next highest number to the side of the play area to indicate the number of the next round [^1].
