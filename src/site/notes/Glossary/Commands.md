A ship can resolve the effect of a command by spending a command dial or command token with the matching icon at the appropriate time. The effect of the command is based on which component was spent:

- **Navigate ():** Resolve during the “Determine Course” step of movement.

  - **Dial:** Increase or decrease the ship’s speed by one, and/or increase the yaw value of one joint by one for this maneuver.
  - **Token:** Increase or decrease the ship’s speed by one.

- **Squadron ():** Resolve after revealing the ship’s command dial.

  - **Dial:** Activate a number of friendly squadrons up to the ship’s squadron value that are at close–medium range of the ship. Each squadron activated in this way can attack and move in either order. The squadrons are chosen and activated one at a time.
  - **Token:** Activate one squadron as described above.

- **Repair ():** Resolve after revealing the ship’s command dial.

  - **Dial:** Gain engineering points equal to the ship’s engineering value and spend them on the following repair effects.
    - **Move Shields:** Spend one point to move one shield by reducing one of the ship’s hull zone’s shield dials by one and then increasing another of its hull zone’s shields by one (without exceeding its maximum shield value).
    - **Recover Shields:** Spend two points to recover one shield on any of the ship’s hull zones (without exceeding its maximum shield value).
    - **Repair Hull:** Spend three points to choose and discard one of the ship’s faceup or facedown damage cards.
  - **Token:** Gain engineering points equal to half of the ship’s engineering value, rounded up, to spend on the above repair effects.
  - A ship can resolve repair effects in any order.
  - A ship can pay for and resolve each effect multiple times if it has the engineering points to do so.
  - When a ship resolves a repair command, it must completely resolve one repair effect before paying for and resolving another. For example, if a ship has five engineering points, it can discard one “Capacitor Failure” damage card and then recover one shield in a hull zone with no shields remaining.
  - After a ship resolves a repair command, it loses any remaining engineering points. Engineering points do not persist from round to round.

- **Concentrate Fire ():** Resolve during the “Resolve Attack Effects” step of an attack.

  - **Dial:** Add one attack die to the attack pool. That die must be of a color that is already in the attack pool.
  - **Token:** Reroll one attack die in the attack pool.

- A ship cannot resolve the same command more than once per round.

- A ship can spend both a command dial and a command token to combine their effects. Doing so counts as a single resolution of the command. For example, a ship can increase its speed twice by spending a Navigate command dial and a Navigate command token.

  - A ship must decide whether it is spending the dial, the token, or both before resolving that command’s effects.

- A player can resolve numerous commands in the same round, such as by spending a Repair command token and a Squadron command token during the “Reveal Command Dial” step of activation, and then spending a Evade command dial during the “Determine Course” step of movement.

- A ship can resolve a command and choose not to produce its effect. It still counts as resolving that command, such as for the purpose of triggering upgrade cards.
