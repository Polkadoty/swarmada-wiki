The setup area is the region of the play area in which ships, squadrons, obstacle tokens, and objective tokens are placed during setup.

The setup area for a 300 fleet point game is the 3' x 4' area in the center of the play area. If playing with a 3' x 3' play area, the entire play area is the setup area.

The setup area is marked by setup area markers. After setup is complete, the setup area markers are removed from the play area.
