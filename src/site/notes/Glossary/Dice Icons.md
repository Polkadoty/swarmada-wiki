Attack dice have the following effects during an attack:

- **Hit ():** This icon adds one damage to the damage total.
- **Critical ():** If the attacker and defender are ships, this icon adds one damage to the damage total and can trigger a critical effect.
- **Accuracy ():** The attacker can spend this icon to choose one of the defenderâ€™s defense tokens. The chosen defense token cannot be spent during this attack.
- A blank face is a die face with no icons on it.
- If players are instructed to roll dice for a purpose other than an attack, the icons on the die have no inherent effects.
