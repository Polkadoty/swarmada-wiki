To execute a maneuver with a ship, its owner proceeds through the following steps:
1. Determine Course: Straighten the maneuver tool, then click the joints of the maneuver tool a number of times in either direction up to the corresponding yaw values indicated on the ship’s speed chart for the current speed. The ship can resolve a M command to adjust speed and/or yaw.
2. Move Ship: Place the maneuver tool on the play area and insert the guides of the first segment into the notches on one side of the front of the ship’s base. Then slide the ship away from the guides on the first segment and place the ship by sliding its notches over the guides on the joint that corresponds to the ship’s speed.
- A ship can move through ships, squadrons, and obstacles without issue. Only its starting and final positions matter.
- A ship must be placed in its final position on the same side of the maneuver tool on which it started its maneuver.
- A ship cannot overlap the maneuver tool when the ship is placed in its final position. If it would overlap the maneuver tool, reset the ship’s position, insert the maneuver tool into the opposite side of the ship, and move the ship. 
- If a ship would not overlap the maneuver tool regardless of which side of the ship the tool is placed on, the ship’s owner can choose which side to place the tool on.
- After the maneuver tool’s guides are inserted into the ship, the joints of the tool cannot be adjusted.
- The maneuver tool can be placed on the play area and manipulated freely during the “Determine Course” step. 
- If a ship executes a 0-speed maneuver, it does not move from its current position, but it is still considered to have executed a maneuver.
- Some effects allow a ship to resolve clicks of yaw while executing a 0-speed maneuver, using the following rules:
	- During the ship’s “Determine Course” step, that ship’s owner declares the number of times and direction in which the last joint of the maneuver tool will be clicked. 
	- During the ship’s “Move Ship” step, the maneuver tool is straightened and the guides of the last segment are inserted into the notches on the side of the front of the ship’s base that matches the declared direction. Then, the ship is slid away from those guides, the last joint of the maneuver tool is clicked the declared number of times in the declared direction, and the ship is placed by sliding its notches back over the last joint.
	- If the ship’s final position would overlap another ship, it cannot finish its maneuver normally, and instead returns to its original position at speed “0” with no clicks of yaw. Both ships are dealt damage cards for overlapping as normal.
