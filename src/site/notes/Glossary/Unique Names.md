A card’s name is unique if there is a bullet (•) to the left of the name.

- A fleet cannot contain more than one card with the same unique name, even if those cards are of different types.
- A fleet cannot contain more than one unique squadron with the same completely-italicized squadron type, even if those cards have different names.
	- Example: Allison adds Lando Calrissian’s Millennium Falcon card to her fleet. Allison cannot also add Han Solo’s Millennium Falcon card. However, Allison can add both Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles’ X-wing Squadron cards to her fleet.
