Objectives alter each game of Star Wars: Armada with new conditions for the battle.

Each player chooses three objective cards as part of their fleet, and each of these cards must belong to a different category. During the “Choose Objective” step of setup, the first player looks at their opponent’s objective cards and chooses one of those cards. The chosen card becomes the objective for the game; the unchosen objective cards and the first player’s objective cards are not used this game.

- There are three categories of objectives:
  - **Assault:** Assault objectives typically identify one or more ships that are worth extra fleet points when damaged or destroyed.
  - **Defense:** Defense objectives alter the play area to provide a significant advantage to one player.
  - **Navigation:** Navigation objectives reward players who maneuver aggressively and precisely.
- When a ship is chosen as an objective ship, indicate this by placing an objective token next to its ship card.
