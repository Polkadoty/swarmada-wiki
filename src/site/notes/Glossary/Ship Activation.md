Ships are activated during the Ship Phase. When a ship is activated, its owner proceeds through the following steps.
1. Reveal Command Dial: Reveal the shipâ€™s top command dial. Then either place the dial next to the ship in the play area or spend the dial to place the corresponding command token next to the ship in the play area.
2. Attack: Perform up to two attacks with the ship from different hull zones.
3. Execute Maneuver: Move the ship at its current speed.
- After a ship activates, place its revealed command dial faceup on its ship card to track that it has activated.
- Each ship can activate only once per round.
