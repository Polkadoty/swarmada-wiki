A single game round consists of four phases resolved in the following order: Command Phase, Ship Phase, Squadron Phase, and Status Phase.

Round tokens are used to track the current round of the game; the round number is equal to the highest number on the round tokens placed next to the play area. The round token marked “1” is placed next to the play area during setup, and the next highest round token is placed during each Status Phase.

The game ends after six rounds.
