Some objective cards, obstacle types, and other effects refer to moving obstacles or tokens. To move an obstacle or token, the player moving it proceeds through the following steps:

1. **Determine Direction:** Place the range ruler flat on the table with the distance side faceup. The center of the distance 1 end of the ruler must be in contact with the obstacle’s edge. If the range ruler cannot be placed in the play area due to other ships and squadrons being in the way, hold the range ruler above the play area and estimate the obstacle or token’s final position.
2. **Move Obstacle (or Token):** Pick up the obstacle or token and position it anywhere along the center of the ruler up to the line that marks the end of the distance band matching the specified maximum movement. The obstacle or token cannot be placed beyond that line. Then remove the range ruler and place the obstacle or token in its final position.
   - An obstacle, at its final position, cannot overlap ships, squadrons, other obstacles, or tokens in the play area.
   - An obstacle can be rotated as long as no part of that obstacle is beyond the specified maximum distance of its move from that obstacle’s original position.
   - An obstacle or token can move through ships, squadrons, and obstacles without issue. Only its starting and final positions matter.
   - If an obstacle with a token placed on it due to an objective card or other effect is moved, that token remains on that obstacle.
   - If an obstacle or token that is overlapped by a ship or squadron is moved, that ship or squadron remains in its current position after the obstacle is moved.
     - If necessary, that ship’s owner may mark that ship’s position and lift it out of the way, then return it after the token is moved.
   - When an obstacle or token moves, the player moving it can choose for it to remain in its current position, unless a minimum movement distance is specified.
   - **Toward:** Some effects direct players to move an obstacle or token toward a ship, squadron, obstacle, other token, or portion of the play area. When this is specified, the player moving the obstacle must also follow these restrictions:
     - This movement must be measured directly toward the other component, along a line from the closest point on the obstacle to the closest point on the other component.
     - That obstacle or token must be moved from its current position to at least the line that marks the end of the distance band matching the specified minimum movement.
     - If that obstacle or token cannot be moved its specified minimum distance, it must be moved from its current position as close as possible to the line that marks the end of the specified minimum distance’s band.
