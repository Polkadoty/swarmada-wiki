An attack is obstructed if line of sight is traced through an obstacle token or another ship that is not the defender.

If an attack is obstructed by one or more ships or obstacles, the attacker must choose and remove one die from their attack pool before they roll dice during the “Roll Attack Dice” step.
- Squadrons do not obstruct attacks.
- If line of sight is drawn over an obstacle, the attack is obstructed even if the bases of the attacker and defender are touching.
  - This includes ships’ shield dials that are touching.
