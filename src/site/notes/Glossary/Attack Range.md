Attack range is the range at which a squadron or a ship’s hull zone can perform an attack as determined by the armament it is using.

- A hull zone’s maximum attack range is close range if it has only black dice in its armament, medium range if it has at least one blue die, or long range if it has at least one red die.
- Each squadron’s attack range is distance 1.
