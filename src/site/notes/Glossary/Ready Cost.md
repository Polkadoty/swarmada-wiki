A ready cost is paid to ready an exhausted non-recur upgrade card by spending the indicated number and type of command tokens.
- If a card has a ready cost it is indicated below the non-recur icon by a numeral and one or more of the following icons over a red background:
    - Command icons: The owning player can pay the cost by spending the indicated number of each type of token shown.
    - If multiple command icons are separated by a horizontal bar below a single number at the top of the column, the owning player may pay the cost by spending that many command tokens of any of the indicated types, in any combination.
    - Any Command icon (): The owning player can pay the cost by spending any command token or mix of command tokens of the indicated number.
- An upgrade card’s ready cost is paid by the ship that card is equipped to.
- If a token or other component is spent as part of a card’s ready cost, that component does not also produce its normal effect [^1].
