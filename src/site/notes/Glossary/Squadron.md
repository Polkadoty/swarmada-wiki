A squadron consists of a plastic squadron base, plastic fighters, a punchboard disk, a punchboard activation slider, and a squadron card. The disk, fighters, and squadron card must all correspond to the same squadron type.

- All copies of a non-unique squadron use a single squadron card.
- Each squadron costs fleet points equal to the fleet point cost on the matching squadron card. 
- If a squadron’s plastic fighters or activation slider impede the movement or placement of other components, rotate the squadron so that the fighters and slider do not impede.
- On squadron cards, the term “you” refers to the squadron resolving the effect.
