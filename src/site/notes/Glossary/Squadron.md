A squadron consists of a plastic squadron base, plastic fighters, a punchboard disk, a punchboard activation slider, and a squadron card. The disk, fighters, and squadron card must all correspond to the same squadron type.

- All copies of a non-unique squadron use a single squadron card.
- Each squadron costs fleet points equal to the fleet point cost on the matching squadron card. 
- If a squadron’s plastic fighters or activation slider impede the movement or placement of other components, rotate the squadron so that the fighters and slider do not impede.
- On squadron cards, the term “you” refers to the squadron resolving the effect [^1].

## FAQ

> [!question] Q: When a squadron activates, is it required to move and/or attack?
> **A:** No. A squadron can activate and end its activation without moving and/or attacking.

> [!question] Q: During setup, can a squadron be placed outside the setup area as long as it is within distance 1-2 of a friendly ship?
> **A:** No. It may be placed outside of the deployment zone, but not outside the setup area.

> [!question] Q: If a ship overlaps a large number of squadrons, can the opposing player place the squadrons in a way that makes it impossible for all of them to touch the ship?
> **A:** No. The player must place as many as possible touching the ship. They cannot space them out in order to prevent some squadrons from touching the ship.

> [!question] Q: If a ship overlaps a large number of squadrons and it is impossible to place all of them touching the ship, where should the remaining squadrons be placed?
> **A:** A squadron that cannot be placed touching the ship must be placed touching another squadron that is touching the ship.

> [!question] Q: When a ship executes a maneuver, if its shield dial or the plastic portion framing that dial is overlapping a squadron's base, does that count as overlapping?
> **A:** Yes. Similarly, a squadron cannot move under or be placed under a ship's shield dial, as this would count as overlapping.

> [!question] Q: If a squadron is at distance 1 of two enemy squadrons, one that it is engaged with and one that it is not engaged with because it is separated by an obstacle, does the original squadron have to attack the engaged squadron?
> **A:** No. A squadron can attack another squadron at distance 1 regardless of whether it is technically engaged with that squadron.

> [!question] Q: Do effects that change a squadron's speed value also apply when the squadron moves because of a card effect?
> **A:** No. A squadron's speed only applied when it performs its standard move during its activation.
