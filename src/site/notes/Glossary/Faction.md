There are four factions in the game: the Rebel faction, the Imperial faction, the Galactic Republic faction, and the Separatist Alliance faction. A ship or squadron is aligned with a faction if its ship card or squadron card displays the faction’s icon. An upgrade card is aligned with a faction if it displays the faction’s icon next to the fleet point cost.
