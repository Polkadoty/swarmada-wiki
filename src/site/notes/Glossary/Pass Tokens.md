A player receives one or more pass tokens at the beginning of the game if their opponent has more ships than they do. When it is a player’s turn to activate during the Ship Phase, that player may spend a pass token to pass their turn instead of activating, and it becomes their opponent’s
turn to activate a ship. When a pass token is spent, it is discarded.

Note: These rules replace the pass token rules previously published in the Super Star Destroyer expansion. A huge ship no longer receives an additional pass token as described in those rules.

- Before the “Deploy Ships” step of setup, if one player has fewer total ships in their fleet, that player gains a number of pass tokens equal to the difference between their total ships and their opponent’s total ships.
- If the first player has fewer ships, that player gains one fewer pass token [^1].
