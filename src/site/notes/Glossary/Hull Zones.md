A hull zone is a section of a ship token delineated by the two firing arc lines that border it. It does **not** include any part of the plastic base.

- Each ship has four hull zones: front, left, right, and rear.
- Squadrons do not have hull zones.
- A hull zone is adjacent to another hull zone if those zones share a firing arc line [^1].
