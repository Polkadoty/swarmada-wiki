During this phase, players secretly and simultaneously choose commands on their command dials and assign them facedown to their ships.

- A ship must be assigned command dials until it has a number of command dials equal to its command value. This may require that more than one dial be assigned to a ship, such as during the first round of the game.
- When assigning a command dial to a ship, the dial is placed under any other command dials already assigned to that ship.
