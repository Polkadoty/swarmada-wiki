Each squadron has one or more keywords with matching keyword icons. Each keyword produces the following effect for that squadron:

- [[Adept\|Adept X]]: While attacking, you may reroll up to X dice.
- [[AI: Battery\|AI: Battery X]] and [[AI: Anti-Squadron\|AI: Anti-Sqadron X]]: While attacking with the indicated armament(s), if you are activated by a [[Glossary/Squadron Command\|Squadron Command]], you may add X dice to your attack pool of a color or colors that are already in your attack pool.
- [[Assault\|Assault]]: While attacking a ship, you may spend 1 die with a Hit icon. If you do, the defender gains 1 raid token of your choice.
- [[Bomber\|Bomber]]: While attacking a ship, each of your Crit icons adds 1 damage to the damage total and you can resolve a critical effect.
- [[Cloak\|Cloak]]: At the end of the [[Glossary/Squadron Phase\|Squadron Phase]], you may move up to distance 1, even if you are engaged.
- [[Counter\|Counter X]]: After a squadron performs a non-[[Counter\|Counter]] attack against you, you may attack that squadron with an anti-squadron armament of blue dice equal to X, even if you are destroyed. 
- [[Dodge\|Dodge X]]: While you are defending against a squadron, during the “Spend Defense Tokens” step, you may choose X dice to be rerolled. 
- [[Escort\|Escort]]: Squadrons you are engaged with cannot attack squadrons that lack [[Escort\|Escort]] unless performing a [[Counter\|Counter]] attack.
- [[Grit\|Grit]]: You are not prevented from moving while you are engaged by only 1 squadron.
	- A squadron with grit is prevented from moving while engaged with multiple squadrons if at least 1 of those squadrons lacks [[Heavy\|Heavy]].
- [[Heavy\|Heavy]]: You do not prevent engaged squadrons from attacking ships or moving. 
- [[Intel\|Intel]]: While a friendly squadron is at distance 1 of you, it has [[Grit\|Grit]].
- [[Relay\|Relay X]]: When a friendly ship resolves a [[Glossary/Squadron Command\|Squadron Command]], if you are in range to be activated, up to X of the squadrons it activates can be at distance 1-3 of you.
- [[Rogue\|Rogue]]: You can move and attack during the Squadron Phase (in any order).
- [[Scout\|Scout]]: While deploying fleets, you can be placed outside of deployment zones and do not need to be at distance 1-2 of a friendly ship, but must be placed beyond distance 1-5 of enemy ships or squadrons.
- [[Screen\|Screen]]: While you are defending against a squadron, for each other friendly squadron the attacker is engaged with that lacks [[Screen\|Screen]], up to 3, you gain [[Dodge\|Dodge 1]].
- [[Snipe\|Snipe X]]: You can attack squadrons at distance 2 with an anti-squadron armament of blue dice equal to X. This attack ignores the [[Counter\|Counter]] keyword.
	- A [[Snipe\|Snipe]] attack can be modified by effects that modify a standard attack, such as the [[Swarm\|Swarm]] keyword.
	- A squadron with [[Snipe\|Snipe]] that is engaged with a squadron with [[Escort\|Escort]] cannot perform a [[Snipe\|Snipe]] attack against another squadron that lacks [[Escort\|Escort]].
- [[Strategic\|Strategic]]: When you end your movement at distance 1 of 1 or more objective tokens, you may move one of those tokens so that it is at distance 1 of you.
	- A squadron with [[Strategic\|Strategic]] cannot move objective tokens that are assigned to a ship.
- [[Swarm\|Swarm]]: While attacking a squadron engaged with another squadron, you may reroll one die.
	- A [[Counter\|Counter]] attack can be modified by effects that modify a standard attack, such as the [[Swarm\|Swarm]] keyword.

- Keywords with a numerical value (an "X" value) are cumulative with themselves. If a squadron that has a numerical-value keyword gains that keyword again through an effect, that keyword’s total value is the sum of the value the squadron already had and the value gained.
	- Example: a Delta-7 Aethersprite squadron has the adept 1 keyword. That squadron gains adept 1 again from another effect. That squadron now has adept 2 for the duration of that effect.
- Keyword text on squadron cards is reminder text. The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the rules for a keyword. If reminder text contradicts that keyword’s rules found in this Rules Reference, the Rules Reference takes precedence [^1].
