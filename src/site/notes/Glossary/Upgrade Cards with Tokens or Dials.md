Some upgrade cards begin the game with a number of command tokens or facedown command dials. These dials or tokens are chosen and placed on the card when that ship is deployed, during the Deploy Ships step of setup.
- If both players need to choose command tokens or dials, they take turns choosing and placing tokens for one card at a time, starting with the first player.
- If an upgrade card begins the game with command tokens or dials, it is indicated in the lower-left corner of that card by a numeral and one or more of the following icons over a blue background:
	- Command icons: The owning player places the indicated number of command tokens of the type shown on the card.
		- If multiple command icons are separated by a horizontal bar below a single number, the owning player places the indicated number of command tokens in any combination of those types that the player chooses.
	- Any Command icon: The owning player chooses and places any command token or mix of command tokens of the indicated number.
	- Command Dial ([[Glossary/Concentrate Fire Command\|Concentrate Fire Command]], [[Glossary/Repair Command\|Repair Command]], [[Glossary/Navigate Command\|Navigate Command]], or [[Glossary/Squadron Command\|Squadron Command]]) icons: Command dials are indicated by a specific command icon surrounded by a block. The owning player sets the indicated number of command dials to the specific command shown and stacks them facedown on the card, similar to a ship’s command stack.
	- Any Dial icon: The owning player sets the indicated number of command dials to any command or mix of commands and stacks them facedown on the card, similar to a ship’s command stack.
- Command tokens or dials on an upgrade card belong to that card and are not assigned to the ship that card is equipped to. 
	- Command tokens or dials on an upgrade card can only be spent or discarded as indicated by that card’s effect.
