A yaw value indicates the maximum number of clicks from the center position that the corresponding join on the maneuver tool can be clicked. A yaw value of "-" means that the joint must remain straight.

- Yaw values vary by ship and speed as displayed on a ship card's speed chart.
- When a yaw value of "-" increases by one, it becomes "I." When a yaw value of "I" increases by one, it becomes "II." The yaw value "II" cannot be increased.
