Some upgrade cards in this expansion refer to proximity mine tokens. When proximity mine tokens are placed, they must be placed beyond distance 1 of any other proximity mine tokens.

- When a ship ends its movement at distance 1 of a proximity mine token, remove that token from the play area and roll two blue dice. That ship is dealt one facedown damage card for each hit or crit icon rolled.
- **Attacking Proximity Mine Tokens**: When a ship performs an attack, it can declare one proximity mine token as a target instead of attacking a ship or squadrons. The defending mine token is treated as a squadron with one hull point that is not friendly to any ship or squadron and has no keywords or defense tokens. If that token suffers at least one point of damage, remove that token from the play area [^1].
