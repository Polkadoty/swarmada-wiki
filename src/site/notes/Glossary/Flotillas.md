Some ships are flotillas. Ships of this type feature two plastic ship models (instead of one). Flotillas follow the same rules as other ships with the following exceptions:

- When a flotilla would overlap another ship (or be overlapped by another ship), deal one facedown damage card to the flotilla. Do not deal a facedown damage card to the closest ship the flotilla overlapped (or that overlapped it) unless that ship is also a flotilla.
- A flotilla cannot equip a  (commander) upgrade card [^1].

## FAQ

> [!question] Q: What ship size are flotillas for the purposes of resolving card effects?
> **A:** A flotilla ship of the ship size defined by its ship token and base. For example, a flotilla ship on a small base is a small ship for all rules and effects interactions. Flotillas are only treated differently when they are overlapped or overlapping other ships.
