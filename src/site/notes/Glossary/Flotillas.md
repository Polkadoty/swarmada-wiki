Some ships are flotillas. Ships of this type feature two plastic ship models (instead of one). Flotillas follow the same rules as other ships with the following exceptions:

- When a flotilla would overlap another ship (or be overlapped by another ship), deal one facedown damage card to the flotilla. Do not deal a facedown damage card to the closest ship the flotilla overlapped (or that overlapped it) unless that ship is also a flotilla.
- A flotilla cannot equip a  (commander) upgrade card.
