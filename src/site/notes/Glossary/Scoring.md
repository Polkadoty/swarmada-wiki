Players determine their score at the end of the game. A player’s score is the total fleet point cost of destroyed enemy ships and squadrons plus the fleet point value of any victory tokens that the player collected.
- A destroyed ship’s fleet point cost includes the costs of all upgrade cards equipped to that ship.
- Discarded upgrade cards do not count toward a player’s score unless they are equipped to a destroyed ship.
- Each victory token is worth the number of fleet points indicated in the lower-right corner of the objective card used for that game [^1].
