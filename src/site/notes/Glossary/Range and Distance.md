The range ruler has two sides: the range side and the distance side. The range side is divided into three range bands: close, medium, and long. The distance side is divided into five distance bands labeled “1” through “5.” The bottom of the ruler is the edge at the close-range end of the ruler.

- When measuring with the range ruler, use only a single edge of the ruler; do not factor in the width and thickness of the ruler.
- The lines on the ruler that divide two adjacent bands always count as part of the band closest to the bottom of the ruler.
- The following terms are used when discussing range and distance:
    - At: If any portion of a hull zone, base, or token is inside a specified band, that component is at that band.
    - Beyond: If no portion of a hull zone, base, or token is inside a specified band or a band closer to the bottom of the ruler, that component is beyond the specified band.
    - Within: If the entirety of a base or token is inside a specified band, that component is within that band.
    - Minimum–Maximum: This abbreviation encompasses the minimum band, maximum band, and all bands in-between, such as “distance 1–4.”
    - Extreme Range: Extreme range is any range greater than the length of the range ruler.

- The ruler is 1' long.
