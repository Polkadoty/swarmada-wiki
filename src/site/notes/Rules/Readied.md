Cards and defense tokens are readied during the Status Phase and begin the game readied. A readied card can be exhausted as part of the cost of an effect.

- When an upgrade card is readied, rotate it 90Â° counterclockwise so that it is upright.
- When a defense token is readied, flip it from its exhausted side to its readied side.
- When a card or defense token is exhausted, it is no longer readied.
- Some upgrade cards that can be exhausted are marked with a recur () icon next to their name and are readied during the Status Phase.
- Some upgrade cards are marked with a non-recur () icon next to their name. These cards do not ready during the Status Phase unless the owning player pays the cost to ready that card.
- If both players can pay to ready cards during the Status Phase, they take turns readying one card at a time, starting with the first player, until one player has no more cards to ready.
- While an upgrade card that is not marked with the recur icon or non-recur icon is exhausted, that card is treated as if it has the recur icon and is readied during the Status Phase.
    - This includes upgrade cards printed prior to the introduction of the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance factions, which are not marked with either icon [^1].
