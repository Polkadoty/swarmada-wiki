Some effects refer to raid tokens. While a ship has a raid token, it cannot resolve the command matching that raid token.

- When a ship with a raid token reveals a command dial, it may discard that dial to discard all of its raid tokens, or it may discard a command token to discard a matching raid token.
- A ship cannot have more than one raid token of each type [^1].
