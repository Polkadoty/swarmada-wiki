Some squadrons are irregular squadrons. Squadrons of this type feature a single plastic fighter model (instead of three). Despite this difference in appearance, irregular squadrons follow all of the rules for normal squadrons.

- When an effect refers to an irregular squadron, it means a squadron that is physically represented by a model on a single peg (instead of a tree peg). For example, this includes squadrons such as YT-2400â€™s or VT-49 Decimators, not A-wings or TIE Interceptors [^1].
