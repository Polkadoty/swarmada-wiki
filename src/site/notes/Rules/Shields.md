Each hull zone has its own shield dial and maximum shield value. The number displayed on the shield dial indicates the hull zoneâ€™s remaining shields.
- Each ship begins the game with its shield dials set to the maximum shield values shown in the corresponding hull zones.
- When a ship spends, loses, or recovers shields, rotate the shield dial to indicate the shields remaining in that hull zone.
- A hull zone cannot have more shields than its maximum shield value, and it cannot recover a shield if it is at its maximum shield value.
- A hull zone cannot have fewer than zero shields, and it cannot lose a shield if it has none remaining [^1].
