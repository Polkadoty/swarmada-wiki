The play area is the shared space occupied by ships, squadrons, obstacle tokens and objective tokens. The recommended play area is 3' x 3' for the core set and 3' x 6' for a 300 fleet point game.

- If any portion of a ship’s or squadron’s base is outside the play area, that ship or squadron is destroyed. For this purpose, ignore activation sliders, shield dials, and the plastic portions of a ship’s base that frame shield dials [^1].
