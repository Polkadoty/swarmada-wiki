Dice can be modified in the following ways by game effects:

- **Reroll:** When a die is rerolled, the attacker picks it up and rolls it again. A die can be rerolled multiple times.
- **Add:** When a die is added, roll an unused die of the appropriate color into the attack pool.
  - The range restriction on dice color applies only when dice are gathered during the “Roll Attack Dice” step of an attack.
- **Change:** When a die is changed, rotate it to display the indicated face.
- **Spend:** When a die or die icon is spent, remove that die from the attack pool.
- **Cancel:** When a die or die icon is canceled, remove it from the attack pool [^1].
