Each player builds a fleet by choosing ships, squadrons, and upgrade cards whose total fleet point cost does not exceed the total agreed upon by the players. The fleet point cost of each ship, squadron, and upgrade is printed in the lower-right corner of the card.

As part of building a fleet, each player must choose three objective cards, one from each category.

- The standard fleet point total is 400 points. If playing with just the core set, the recommended fleet point total is 180.
- Players may build fleets of any fleet point total as long as they both agree on the total.
- A fleet must be aligned with a faction, such as Rebel-aligned or Imperial-aligned. It cannot contain any ships, squadrons, or upgrades that are aligned with another faction.
  - Some cards have a dual faction affiliation, indicated by a split faction symbol that shows both of the factions that card is affiliated with. A fleet of either of those factions can equip that card.
- A fleet must have one flagship and cannot have more than one flagship.
- A ship cannot equip more than one copy of the same upgrade card.
- A fleet cannot spend more than one third of its fleet points, rounded up, on squadrons.
- A fleet can contain **one** unique squadron with defense tokens for each 100 points of the agreed fleet-point total [^1].
## FAQ

> [!question] Q: During fleet-building, how many fleet points can a player spend on squadrons?
> **A:** While using standard fleet-building rules, a player can spend up to one third of the fleet point total, rounded up. For example, if playing a 200 point game, a fleet could contain 67 points of squadrons, even if the total cost of that fleet was only 190.
