Each ship has a speed chart on its ship card which indicates how far each joint can be clicked away from the center (straight) position. Each column on the chart corresponds to a specific speed as indicated by a number at the bottom of that column. Each box in a column represents a joint on the maneuver tool and the yaw value within each box indicates how many times its corresponding joint can be clicked in either direction (left or right) when moving at that columnâ€™s speed [^1].
