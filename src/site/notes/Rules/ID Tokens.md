Players use ID tokens to distinguish their ships during a game. Each flagship must be assigned a flagship ID token pair of the appropriate faction. If a player has multiple copies of the same ship, they must assign ID tokens to each of those ships. If both players’ fleets belong to the same faction, each player must assign ID tokens to each of their ships and squadrons. ID tokens are assigned during the “Gather Components” step of setup.

- A ship ID token is assigned to a ship by inserting the token into the ship’s ID slot and placing the main ship ID token with the same number or icon on that ship’s card.
- A squadron ID token is assigned to a squadron by inserting it into the squadron’s ID slot.
- All of a fleet’s ID tokens must display the same color and cannot display the color being used by the opposing fleet [^1].
