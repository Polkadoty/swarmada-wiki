To perform an attack with a squadron or ship, resolve the following steps:

1. **Declare Target:** The attacker declares the defender and the attacking hull zone, if any. If the defender is a ship, the attacker declares the defending hull zone. Measure line of sight to the defender to ensure the attack is possible and to determine if it is obstructed.
   - If the attacker is a ship, the defending squadron or hull zone must be inside the attacking hull zone’s firing arc and at attack range of the attacking hull zone.
   - If the attacker is a squadron, the defending squadron or hull zone must be at distance 1.

2. **Roll Attack Dice:** Gather attack dice to form the [[Rules/Attack Pool\|Attack Pool]] and roll those dice. Gather only the dice that are appropriate for the range of the attack as indicated by the icons on the range ruler.
   - If the defender is a ship, gather the attack dice indicated in the attacking hull zone’s or squadron’s battery armament.
   - If the defender is a squadron, gather the attack dice indicated in the attacker’s anti-squadron armament.
   - If the attacker cannot gather any dice appropriate for the range of the attack, the attack is canceled.

3. **Resolve Attack Effects:** The attacker can resolve attack effects as described below:
   - Modify Dice: The attacker can resolve any of its effects that modify its dice. This includes card effects and the [[Concentrate Fire\|Concentrate Fire]] command.
   - Spend Accuracy Icons: The attacker can spend one or more of its accuracy icons to choose the same number of the defender’s defense tokens. The chosen tokens cannot be spent during this attack.

4. **Spend Defense Tokens:** The defender can spend one or more of its defense tokens.

5. **Resolve Damage:** The attacker can resolve one of its critical effects. Then the attacker determines the total damage amount. Then the defending squadron or hull zone suffers that total damage, one point at a time.
   - If the attacker or defender is a squadron, the damage is the sum of all hit icons.
   - If the attacker **and** defender are ships, the damage is the sum of all hit and crit icons.
   - Each ship has the following standard [[Rules/Critical Effects\|critical effect]]: “Crit: If the defender is dealt at least one damage card by this attack, deal the first damage card faceup.”

6. **Declare Additional Squadron Target:** If the attacker is a ship and the defender was a squadron, the attacker can declare another enemy squadron as a defender and repeat steps 2 through 6. The new defender must be inside the firing arc and at attack range of the same attacking hull zone, and the attacker must measure line of sight to it as normal. Each enemy squadron can be targeted only once per attack.
   - Treat each repetition of steps 2 through 6 as a new attack for the purposes of resolving card effects.

- A ship can perform two attacks during its activation, but it cannot attack from the same hull zone more than once per activation.
- A ship can attack the same target with different attacks.
- A ship can attack an engaged squadron.
- Ships and squadrons cannot attack friendly ships and squadrons [^1].

## FAQ:

> [!question] Q: When a ship resolves an ability that allows it to add dice to the attack pool, can it add those dice if their color is not normally appropriate for the range of the attack?
> **A:** Yes. The range restrictions on dice color applies only when dice are gathered during the "Roll Attack Dice" step of the attack.

> [!question] Q: If a ship's attack would not include any dice, but the ship can add dice through a card effect, can it perform the attack?
> **A:** No. If a ship does not gather any dice during the "Roll Attack Dice" step of an attack, the attack is canceled.

> [!question] Q: When measuring line of sight, do the attacker's hull zones block line of sight?
> **A:** No.

> [!question] Q: While measuring line of sight, if a ship is in the way, do its shield dials and their plastic frames affect line of sight in any way?
> **A:** No. However, when determining line of sight, all of the other parts of a ship's plastic base can obstruct line of sight.

> [!question] Q: Can a ship attack an engaged squadron?
> **A:** Yes.
