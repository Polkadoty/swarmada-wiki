During this phase, the first player activates one of their ships. Then the second player activates one of their own ships. Players continue taking turns in this manner until all ships have been activated.
- Players cannot activate ships that have already been activated.
- If a player has no unactivated ships remaining, that player must pass their turn for the rest of the phase. Doing so does not require spending a pass token.
	- If a player has unactivated ships but they are prevented from activating those ships by game effects, that player must pass their turn. Doing so does not require spending a pass token.
- When a player passes their turn, it becomes their opponent’s turn to activate a ship.
- When it is a player’s turn to activate, if that player has any unactivated ships, they can pass their turn by spending a pass token. When a pass token is spent, it is discarded.
- A player with unactivated ships remaining can pass their turn under the following conditions:
	- The first player may pass their turn if they have activated at least one ship and they have fewer unactivated ships than the second player. 
	- The second player may pass their turn if they do not have more unactivated ships than the first player.
	- A player cannot spend a pass token on consecutive turns during the same Ship Phase.

Example: Anna is the first player and Max is the second player. After Anna activates the first ship, she has two unactivated ships remaining and Max has one unactivated ship. Max decides to pass and spends a pass token. Then, Anna activates another ship. After that ship is activated, Max cannot pass again even though he and Anna have an equal number of unactivated ships remaining, because Max cannot pass two consecutive turns to activate [^1].
