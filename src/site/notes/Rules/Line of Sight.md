When resolving an attack, players measure line of sight between ships and squadrons in the play area to determine if an attack is possible and whether it is obstructed.

- To determine line of sight, a player uses the range ruler to trace a line between the attacking squadron or hull zone and the defending squadron or hull zone.
- When tracing line of sight to or from a squadron, trace the line using the point of the squadron’s base that is closest to the opposing squadron or hull zone.
- When tracing line of sight to or from a hull zone, trace the line using the yellow targeting point printed in that hull zone.
- If line of sight or attack range is traced through a hull zone on the defender that is not the defending hull zone, the attacker does not have line of sight and must choose another target.
- If line of sight is traced through an obstacle token or through a ship that is not the attacker or defender, the attack is obstructed.
  - When tracing line of sight, ignore ships’ shield dials and the plastic portions of the base that frame the shield dial.
  - While a ship is overlapping an obstacle and the attacking hull zone’s traced line of sight does not pass over a visible portion of that obstacle (or another obstacle or ship), that attack is not obstructed.
  - If line of sight is traced through the attacking or defending hull zone’s shield dial and that dial is also overlapping an obstacle, that attack is treated as obstructed.
- Squadrons do not block or obstruct line of sight.
- The attacker’s hull zones do not block its line of sight.
- If players must trace a line that is longer than the range ruler, they can estimate the line extended from the end of the ruler [^1].
