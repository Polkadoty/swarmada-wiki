![Yaw At Speed 0](https://c.l3n.co/i/z4w5Xm.png)

To resolve a 0-speed maneuver with one or more clicks of yaw:
1. Declare the direction and number of clicks of yaw for the maneuver.
2. Insert the guides of the last segment of the maneuver tool into the notches on the ship's base, then remove the ship.
3. Click the last joint in the declared direction, then place the ship in its final position.
