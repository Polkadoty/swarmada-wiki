To execute a maneuver with a ship, its owner proceeds through the following steps:
1. Determine Course: Straighten the maneuver tool, then click the joints of the maneuver tool a number of times in either direction up to the corresponding yaw values indicated on the ship’s speed chart for the current speed. The ship can resolve a M command to adjust speed and/or yaw.
2. Move Ship: Place the maneuver tool on the play area and insert the guides of the first segment into the notches on one side of the front of the ship’s base. Then slide the ship away from the guides on the first segment and place the ship by sliding its notches over the guides on the joint that corresponds to the ship’s speed.
- A ship can move through ships, squadrons, and obstacles without issue. Only its starting and final positions matter.
- A ship must be placed in its final position on the same side of the maneuver tool on which it started its maneuver.
- A ship cannot overlap the maneuver tool when the ship is placed in its final position. If it would overlap the maneuver tool, reset the ship’s position, insert the maneuver tool into the opposite side of the ship, and move the ship. 
- If a ship would not overlap the maneuver tool regardless of which side of the ship the tool is placed on, the ship’s owner can choose which side to place the tool on.
- After the maneuver tool’s guides are inserted into the ship, the joints of the tool cannot be adjusted.
- The maneuver tool can be placed on the play area and manipulated freely during the “Determine Course” step. 
- If a ship executes a 0-speed maneuver, it does not move from its current position, but it is still considered to have executed a maneuver.
- Some effects allow a ship to resolve clicks of yaw while executing a 0-speed maneuver, using the following rules:
	- During the ship’s “Determine Course” step, that ship’s owner declares the number of times and direction in which the last joint of the maneuver tool will be clicked. 
	- During the ship’s “Move Ship” step, the maneuver tool is straightened and the guides of the last segment are inserted into the notches on the side of the front of the ship’s base that matches the declared direction. Then, the ship is slid away from those guides, the last joint of the maneuver tool is clicked the declared number of times in the declared direction, and the ship is placed by sliding its notches back over the last joint.
	- If the ship’s final position would overlap another ship, it cannot finish its maneuver normally, and instead returns to its original position at speed “0” with no clicks of yaw. Both ships are dealt damage cards for overlapping as normal [^1].

## FAQ

> [!question] Q: When a ship executes a maneuver, does it move along the maneuver tool?
> **A:** No. The ship is picked up from its starting position and placed in its final position. It ignores any obstacles, ships, and squadrons that its base does not overlap in its final position.

> [!question] Q: When a ship executes a maneuver, is it destroyed if part of the maneuver tool is outside the play area but the ship itself is entirely inside the play area?
> **A:** No.

> [!question] Q: When a ship overlaps more than one ship, how does a player determine which of those ships is closest?
> **A:** The player measures range to the overlapped ship that appears to be closer and temporarily marks that measurement (such as by holding their thumbnail where the rules reaches the overlapped ship). If the second range measurement is beyond the marked measurement, the first ship is closer; otherwise, the second ship is closer.

> [!question] Q: If a ship executes its maneuver so that it is exactly touching another ship or squadron at its final position, did the ship that moved overlap the ships or squadrons that it is touching?
> **A:** No.

> [!question] Q: If a ship overlaps another ship and suffers damage so that it has damage cards equal to its hull value but its final position is overlapping the station obstacle, is that ship destroyed?
> **A:** Yes. The station's effect is not resolved until after the ship executes its maneuver.

> [!question] Q: When a ship executes a maneuver such that a portion of the ship would be outside the play area at its final plotted position, but the ship overlaps another ship at that position and finishes its move entirely inside the play area, is the ship that is moving destroyed?
> **A:** No.

> [!question] Q: When an effect instructs a ship to execute a maneuver outside of its usual Execute Maneuver step, what is that ship's speed?
> **A:** While executing that additional maneuver, the ship's speed is temporarily set to the speed indicated by the effect that is resolved. The ship executes the maneuver by completing the Determine Course and Move Ship steps. The ship's current speed is still tracked by its speed dial, and the ship does not count as having changed its speed.
