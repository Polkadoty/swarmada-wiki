A critical effect, denoted by the “Crit” header, can resolve if there is at least one Crit icon in the attack pool.

- The attacker can resolve only one critical effect per attack.
- The attacker does not spend a die icon to resolve a critical effect unless the effect says otherwise.
- Critical effects resolve at the beginning of the “Resolve Damage” step of an attack.
- The standard critical effect is “Crit: If the defender is dealt at least one damage card by this attack, deal the first damage card faceup.”
- Squadrons cannot resolve or suffer critical effects unless otherwise specified [^1].
