To measure a hull zone’s firing arc, use the range ruler to extend the firing arc lines that are printed on the ship token around that hull zone. If a portion of any component is inside the area between those extended firing arc lines, that component is inside the firing arc.

To measure attack range from a ship, measure from the closest point of the attacking hull zone. To measure attack range to a ship, measure to the closest point of the defending hull zone. To measure attack range to or from a squadron, measure to or from the closest point of the squadron’s base.

When measuring attack range for a ship, ignore any portion of the defender that is outside the attacking hull zone’s firing arc, even if that portion is at a closer range.

If attack range is measured through a hull zone on the defender that is not the defending hull zone, the attacker does not have line of sight and must choose another target.

- Targeting points are not used when measuring range; they are exclusively for determining line of sight.
- When measuring non-attack range or distance between two components, measure from the closest point of the first component to the closest point of the second component.
- A ship or squadron is always at close range and distance 1 of itself.
- When measuring firing arc, range, or distance, ignore squadrons’ activation sliders and ships’ shield dials and the plastic portions of the base that frame the shield dial [^1].
