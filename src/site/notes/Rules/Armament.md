The attacker’s armament indicates the color and number of dice that can be used during an attack. Anti-squadron armament is used when attacking a squadron. Battery armament is used when attacking a ship.

- Each hull zone of a ship has its own battery armament that it uses when the ship attacks from that hull zone.
- Each squadron has a single battery armament.
- A ship has one anti-squadron armament that is used regardless of which hull zone is attacking.
- A battery armament or anti-squadron armament with a “–” value has no dice. [^1]
