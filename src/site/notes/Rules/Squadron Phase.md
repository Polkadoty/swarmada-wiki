During this phase, the first player activates two of their squadrons. Then the second player activates two of their own squadrons. Players continue taking turns in this manner until all squadrons have been activated.

- A player does not choose the second squadron to activate until after they finish activating the first one.
- If a player only has one unactivated squadron remaining when they must choose their first squadron to activate, they only activate that squadron.
- If a player has no unactivated squadrons remaining, they must pass their turn for the rest of the phase.
- A squadron can either move or attack when activated during this phase; it cannot do both [^1].
