Before beginning a game, the players may agree to use one or more of the following optional rules.

## Unlimited Rounds

Players who want to play a death match to the bitter end can use this rule. The game does not end after the sixth round; instead, the game ends only when all of one player's ships are destroyed. Do not use objectives when playing with this rule, but place obstacles as normal. In addition, at the end of each round, the player with initiative gives initiative to their opponent by passing the initiative token to that player.

## Team Play

Star Wars Armada is designed for two players, but it can be enjoyed by more; simply split the players as equally as possible into two teams. Each team controls one fleet. Each team must also nominate a Team Commander from among its members.

Each player takes exclusive control of one or more of that team's ship and squadron cards and makes all decisions for the corresponding ships and squadrons. This includes choosing commands, attacking, spending tokens, etc.

During the Command Phase, each player chooses commands for only the ships that player controls. A player may discuss their choices with their teammates, but they must do so openly at the table and cannot show their command dials to another player. During the Ship Phase, the players must agree on which ship to activate when it is their team's turn to activate a ship. During the Squadron Phase, the team must agree on which squadrons to activate.

If teammates cannot come to an agreement on a choice, the Team Commander makes the final decision.

If all of one player's ships and squadrons are destroyed, that player's team continues to play and can win by destroying all of the opposing team's ships or by having the highest score after six rounds.
