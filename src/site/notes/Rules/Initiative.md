Initiative determines which player acts first during the Ship Phase and Squadron Phase. It is assigned to a player during the “Determine Initiative” step of setup. That player is the first player and takes the initiative token. That player’s opponent is the second player.

- The first player retains initiative for the entire game [^1].
