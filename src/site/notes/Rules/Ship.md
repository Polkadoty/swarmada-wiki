A ship consists of a ship base, a ship model, a ship token, and a ship card. All components must match the ship’s type, and the name on the ship card must match the name on the ship token.
- Each ship has a ship icon in the lower-left corner of its ship card and in the front hull zone of its ship token. This icon indicates the ship’s type and is used to determine which title cards that ship can equip.
- Some ships have traits. These are italicized words listed on the back of their ship cards, beneath the ship’s name. Traits do not have an effect, but some other game effects can refer to ship traits.
- Ship cards were printed as tarot-size cards prior to the introduction of the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance factions. These cards remain legal game components.
- Some plastic ship models extend beyond the plastic base. For this reason, the plastic ship model does not affect range measurement, firing arc, movement, overlapping, or any other game mechanic [^1].
