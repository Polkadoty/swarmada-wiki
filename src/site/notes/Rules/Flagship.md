A flagship is a ship equipped with a commander card. Some objective cards include special rules for flagships.

- Any ship can be a flagship regardless of the upgrade icons in its upgrade bar.
- A fleet must have one flagship and cannot have more than one.
- Each flagship must be assigned a flagship ID token pair of the appropriate faction [^1].
