## Open, Derived, and Hidden Information

### Open Information

Open information is any information about the game, game state, or ships that is available to all players. This includes faceup damage cards, any relevant tokens, the chosen objective, discarded upgrade cards, and any other information continuously available to all players.

All players are entitled access to open information and cannot hide open information from an opponent or omit specific details. A player must allow their opponent to discover the information themselves if they attempt to do so.

### Derived Information

Derived information is any information about the game, game state, or ships all players have had the opportunity to learn through card/game effects or through the process of deduction using open information. This includes each player's current score, how many of a particular damage card might remain in a damage deck, which ship a dial belongs to, etc.

Derived information may be marked with the use of a token or other indicator so that players remember the information. A player cannot misrepresent derived information or hide the open information necessary to discover derived information.

If derived information is dependent on a player's previous decision or action, they must answer truthfully when asked about that decision or action. For example, Steph chooses two ships for the objective [[Most Wanted\|Most Wanted]]. During a round later in the game, Bryan forgets which ships were chosen and asks Steph. Steph must answer honestly which two ships she chose for the objective.

### Hidden Information

Hidden information is any information about the game, game state, or ships unavailable to one or more players. This includes facedown damage cards (even if they were previously faceup), facedown maneuver dials, cards within the damage deck, etc.

A player cannot learn hidden information without the aid of a game effect, rule, or another player verbally communicating the information. However, if a player that has access to hidden information about the game or a card and chooses to verbally share it with their opponent, that player is not required to tell the truth.
